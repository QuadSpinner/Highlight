# Lighthouse

Lighthouse is an open source extension for Visual Studio developed at [QuadSpinner](http://quadspinner.com) to help us code better.

It lets you arbitrarily highlight any piece of code without affecting existing color coding. With decorations such as blurring, contoured blocks, and full line highlighting it can make your code look attractive while making it much easier to identify specific variables or elements.
